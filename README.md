# RimWorld-ShareTheLoad
Mostly obsolete as of RimWorld 1.5!

Get The [TD Enhancement Pack](https://github.com/alextd/RimWorld-EnhancementPack/releases) for the little features from this mod that 1.5 did not add:

* Multiple people Make way for blueprints: cut trees, etc.
* Dedicated cutters, not assigned to building, also make way for blueprints.

1.5 DID add the main feature of thid mod, allowing multiple people to deliver resources. But not these. But these are too little to maintain a mod for.

RimWorld mod - allow multiple people to deliver to blueprints/frames
